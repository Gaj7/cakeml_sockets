This project builds with the following version of the CakeML compiler: https://cakeml.org/regression/artefacts/690/cake-x64-64.tar.gz. Newer versions of the compiler introduced the `instream` and `outstream` types, which prevent the use of the TextIO functions with our file descriptors (only because the constructors are kept local. If this were added to the basis, it wouldn't be a problem).

To build the project, type `make CAKE_DIR=x` where `x` is the path/directory which includes the cake executable and `basis_ffi.c`. To test the sockets, run `serverTest` first, then `clientTest`. The server test opens a listening socket on port 5000 (chosen arbitrarily) and waits for an incoming message. The client test connects to this socket (using loopback address 127.0.0.1), sends a string, and then terminates. Finally, the server prints the message and terminates.
